Alice has a hand of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size W, and consists of W consecutive cards.

Return true if and only if she can.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
Example 2:

Input: hand = [1,2,3,4,5], W = 4
Output: false
Explanation: Alice's hand can't be rearranged into groups of 4.
```


## Solution

```python
import collections 

class Solution(object):
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand, W):
        count = collections.Counter(hand)
        while count:
            m = min(count)
            for k in xrange(m, m+W):
                v = count[k]
                if not v: return False
                if v == 1:
                    del count[k]
                else:
                    count[k] = v - 1
        return True
```
