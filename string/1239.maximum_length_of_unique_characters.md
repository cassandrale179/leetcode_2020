# Problem
Given an array of strings arr. String s is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of arr which have unique characters.
Return the maximum possible length of s.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and "ique".
Maximum length is 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".
```
Example 3:
```
Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
 ```
 
### Solution 
- Step 1: Check first if there is any word with duplicate characters:
```python
input = ["aaa"]
output = 0
```
- Step 2: 
    + create an array called "keys" which will contain ALL the potential combination fo the words.
    + right now keys =  ["cha","r","act","ers"] 
    + for each word in the original array, concatenate it with the word in keys; 
        => ["chacha", "char", "chaact", "chaers"]  (for "cha") 
        + append it to the keys array 
        ["cha","r","act","ers", "chacha", "char", "chaact", "chaers"] 
        => ["chacha", "char", "chaact", "chaers"]  (for "r") 

 
```python
import collections
class Solution:
    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:
    
        # Step 1. check if any duplicate characters 
        keys = []
        for word in arr:
            if len(set(word)) == len(word):
                keys.append(word)
        # Step 2 
        for a in arr:
            for b in keys[:]:
                new_word = a + b
                if len(set(new_word)) == len(new_word):
                    keys.append(new_word)
        if len(keys) == 0:
            return 0
        return max(len(a) for a in keys) 
```
