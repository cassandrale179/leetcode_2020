# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/ 

## Problem 
**Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
 ```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

## Problem Approach
The hashmap approach: 
```
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        answer = 0
        d = {}
        for j in range(0, len(s)):
            if s[j] not in d:
                d[s[j]] = j 
            else:
                for key in d.keys():
                    if d[key] < d[s[j]]:
                        del d[key]
                d[s[j]] = j 
            answer = max(len(d), answer)
        return answer
```
