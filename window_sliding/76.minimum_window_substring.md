# 76. Minimum Window Substring

## Problem Statement
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:
```
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```
Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

## Solution

### Approach 1 (Sliding Window) 

- **Built a validation function** to check if s contains all letter in t. 
    - We have a imported library called Counter, which returns frequency of each letter 
    ```python
    s1 = "aaabbc" 
    d1 = Counter(s1) 
    --> {"a: 3, "b": 2, "c": 1 } 
    ```
    - We check for frequency of both s and t. If for every character in s, its frequency is higher than t, then we return True. 
- Create two pointers, left and right. 
     - Extend the right pointer as far as possible until we encounter a valid window
     - If we found a valid window, move the left pointer until the window is no longer valid
     - Record the minimum window 
     - Then extend the right pointer again 
- Solution 
```python
from collections import Counter 
class Solution(object):
    
    # 1. Return true if substring contains all char in s2 
    def validate(self, s1, t): 
        d1 = Counter(s1)
        d2 = Counter(t)
        for key in d2: 
            if d1[key] < d2[key]:
                return False
        return True
                
    # 2. Main function
    def minWindow(self, s, t):
        left, right = 0, 0 
        ans = ""
        while right < len(s)+1: 
            substr = s[left:right]  
            while self.validate(substr, t):
                if ans == "" or len(substr) < len(ans): 
                    ans = substr
                left += 1  
                substr = s[left:right]  
            right += 1  
        return ans
 ```
