## Solution 

### Brute force:
  - we have two pointers, left and right, which correspond to subarray A[left:right] that is our answer. 
  - Keep increasing right pointer while the condition still hold (that is max and min of subarray is <= limit) 
  - If condition doesn't hold, we increase the left pointer 

```python
class Solution(object):
     def longestSubarray(self, nums, limit):
            left, right = 0, 0
            for right in range(0, len(nums)):
                min_ = min(nums[left:right+1])
                max_ = max(nums[left:right+1])
                if max_ - min_ > limit:
                    left += 1 
            return right - left + 1 
```
- Runtime: this runtime is most likely O(n^2) because we constantly need to find what is the min_ and max_ of the curernt subarary. We need to optimize this. 


### Deques
Revisit this later. But what happen is:
- We need to keep 2 list (maxl, minl) one in increasing order and one in decreasing order (store index of the array) 
- The first item in the list keeps track of the index of min and max of that subarray
- If maxl[0] - minl[0] > limit, we move pointer left & we need to remove the front of whichever list that has index < left to shrink the subarray
